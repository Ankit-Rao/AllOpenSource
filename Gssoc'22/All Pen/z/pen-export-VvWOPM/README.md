# MorphSVGPlugin from GreenSock

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/pyrografix/pen/VvWOPM](https://codepen.io/pyrografix/pen/VvWOPM).

Demonstrates some nifty SVG morphing capabilities in the new MorphSVGPlugin from GreenSock. Notice the start and end shapes don't need to have matching quantities (or types) of points. 

MorphSVGPlugin is a membership benefit of Club GreenSock: http://greensock.com/club/ ("Shockingly Green" level and higher)
