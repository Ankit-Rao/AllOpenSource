# Radial animated progress #2

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/vYLzwmY](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/vYLzwmY).

[See me code this](https://youtu.be/I8lTo7keD1I). Solution to [this challenge](https://twitter.com/anatudor/status/1280764370713280512) I launched on twitter.

Here's [part #1](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/GRoxvOr), which I coded a couple of years back and explained in [this CSS-Tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/simple-interactive-pie-chart-with-css-variables-and-houdini-magic/), in case you need a refresher.

Only works in browsers supporting `-webkit-mask-clip: text`, which is only WebKit browsers for now. Only animated in browsers that support Houdini, which is just Chromium browsers for now.
