# Pure CSS expanding search with custom properties (no pre-Chromium Edge support)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/PBXRRm](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/PBXRRm).

[See me code this](https://youtu.be/_pcXWydkFWw) in about 30 minutes (you can speed it up if you think I'm too slow).  Tested and works in Chrome and Firefox. Doesn't work in Edge due to lack of support for `clip-path` and some `calc()` bugs.

If the work I've been putting out since the spring of 2012 has helped you in any way or you just like it and you wish me to be able to continue making stuff, please consider one of the following:

* being a cool cat 😼🎩 and becoming a patron on Patreon

* making a one time donation via Ko-fi

* or at least sharing this to show the rest of the world what can be done with CSS these days

Thank you!
