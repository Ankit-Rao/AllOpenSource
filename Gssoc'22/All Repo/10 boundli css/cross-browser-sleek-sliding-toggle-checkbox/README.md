[Watch me code this](https://youtu.be/32U-6g6VpLg) in 12 minutes (you can tweak the play speed if you feel I'm too slow). Compact and clean code.

If you like my work in general and this demo in particular and you wish me to be able to continue putting out stuff, please consider one of the following:

* being a cool cat 😺 and becoming a patron on Patreon

[![become a patron button](https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png)](https://www.patreon.com/anatudor)

* getting me something off my Amazon WishList
