If the work I've been putting out for the past 9 years (I started coming up with clever solutions to questions on Stack Overflow in the spring of 2012) has helped you in any way or you just like it and you wish me to be able to continue putting out stuff, please consider one of the following:

* being a cool cat 😼🎩 and becoming a patron on Patreon

Thank you!
