# Day/ night toggle

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/JqzxVO](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/JqzxVO).

[See me code this](https://youtu.be/oK4vkE6IOBM) in under 10 minutes (you can speed it up if I'm too slow). Uses only a checkbox and its label.  Creates the star with the [mixin](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/KLyjBx/) I coded recently. No images, no icon fonts, no JS.

If you like the work I've been putting out for the past ¾ of a decade in general and this demo in particular, please consider one of the following:

Changes from [original](https://codepen.io/himalayasingh/pen/eaejBQ):

* uses a single `label` element, no children

* the star is created with the `:before` pseudo-element + the star mixin

* the moon is created with the `:after` pseudo-element

* uses a CSS  switch variable `--i` to simplify the code
