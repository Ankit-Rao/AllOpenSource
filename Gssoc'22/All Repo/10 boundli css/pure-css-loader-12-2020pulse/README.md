Last year, I [wrote](https://css-tricks.com/various-methods-for-expanding-a-box-while-preserving-the-border-radius/) about methods of expanding a box while preserving its border-radius and I think I've just found a new one - used in this demo:  use a parent with `overflow: hidden` and a pseudo-element with the same `border-radius` and then move the pseudo within its parent so that how much gets cut off varies with the amount of motion.

If the work I've been putting out since 2012 has helped you in any way or you just like it, you can support it with a gift to keep me afloat:
