# Custom Radio Buttons

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/qrMOvX](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/qrMOvX).

Changes ([watch me code them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlp0VDbm6VI)):

* compacted the SVG check icon from 1337 bytes to 222 bytes (down to a sixth of the original) - see it [in a pen](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/mWjZVB/)

* compacted the markup by eliminating unneeded elements and generating it within a Pug loop

* used the SVG check icon only once in the CSS

* set the solid custom radio backgrounds within a loop
