A while ago, I was on the [NASA Exoplanets website](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/) and the little spinning galaxy icon caught my attention and I just had to see how it was made.

I discovered it was using SVG, CSS animations and 3D transforms. And that I could get the same result with less code. Which is just what I did right now when I remembered about it and also happened to have some time.
