# Pure CSS double ball helix

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/JreoKw](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/JreoKw).

[Watch me code this in ~10minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCF5OU4VC6M) .  Tested and fully works in WebKit browsers. Firefox doesn't support `calc()` in `hsl()` so, while the ball positioning and animation works, all the balls are grey. Edge doesn't support using  `calc()` in `rotate()` or nested `calc()` (this one may have been fixed in the update coming this week).

If the work I've been putting out since 2012 has helped you in any way or you just like it and you wish me to be able to continue putting out stuff, please consider one of the following:

* being a cool cat 😼🎩 and becoming a patron on Patreon

* or at least sharing this to show the rest of the world what can be done with CSS these days

Thank you!

Drawn some inspiration from [this gif](http://sasj.tumblr.com/post/164343184370/geometric-animations-170818) by [Saskia Freeke](https://twitter.com/sasj_nl). I saw it after I first had the helix idea, but before I coded it and it's what made me tone it down to just two strands instead of the jungle-like thing with multiple strands I had originally thought of doing. It seems cleaner this way, better from a performance point of view and it's easier to understand what's going on.
