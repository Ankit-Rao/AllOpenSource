# CSS Heart animation (no JS)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/ImBobby/pen/HxnBv](https://codepen.io/ImBobby/pen/HxnBv).

implementing usage of :not selector. the rest just usual animation and animation-delay property. I do admire javascript animation but I love take harder way :)

inspired by maciekmp's previously pen    (http://codepen.io/maciekmp/pen/tdoef)
