# cubeuler (pure CSS 3D)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/BLkvVB](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/BLkvVB).

Live coded in 25 minutes on the 28th of September 2016. Tested and works in WebKit browsers (though I'm not happy with the tiny spaces between tile faces â˜¹ ). Sadly, Edge seems to mess up transforms and Firefox messes up 3D order. Inspired by [this Dribble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/2392881-Cubeuler) by [Mike DiLuigi](http://www.mikediluigi.com/):
