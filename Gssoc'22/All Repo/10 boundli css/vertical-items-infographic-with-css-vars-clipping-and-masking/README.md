# Vertical items infographic with CSS vars, clipping and masking

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/EpeJvb](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/EpeJvb).

Solution to [this challenge](https://twitter.com/anatudor/status/1026782477682176002) - use just one paragraph element for each of the three items (no children, no SVG, no JS). [Watch me code it](https://youtu.be/urfttwyOpDQ) in 38 minutes (you can tweak the play speed if you feel I'm too slow). Ugly in Edge as Edge doesn't yet support clipping and masking on HTML elements (masking is [in development](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/masks/) though).

If you like this demo in particular and my work in general and you want me to be able to continue putting stuff out, please consider one of the following:

* getting me something from my Amazon WishList: [ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸](https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2Y3C4722GXH0I/) / [ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/wishlist/2I25W7U0KADSR/)

* [voting for `clip-path` implementation in Edge](https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-microsoft-edge-developer/suggestions/6519995-support-clip-path-property) - it doesn't even require signing in and **your votes do matter**!

* or at least sharing this to show the rest of the world what can be done with CSS on the web these days

Thank you to everyone who has supported my work so far!
