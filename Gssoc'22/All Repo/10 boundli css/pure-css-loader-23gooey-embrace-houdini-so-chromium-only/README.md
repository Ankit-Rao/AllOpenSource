# Pure CSS loader #23 - gooey embrace (Houdini, so chromium only)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/LYEqvZK](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/LYEqvZK).

Animates a custom property using Houdini, so it can only work in browsers that support this. Which, at the moment (January 2020), means only Chromium browsers, sorry.

If the work I've been putting out since 2012 has helped you in any way or you just like it, you can support it with a gift to keep me afloat:
