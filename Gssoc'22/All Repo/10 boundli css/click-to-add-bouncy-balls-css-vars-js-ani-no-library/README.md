A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/ayOGOa](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/ayOGOa).

[Watch me code this in ~28 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw3GLTT8MKQ) (you can also speed it up if you feel I'm typing/ speaking too slow).  Cross-browser. No library and under 90 lines of vanilla JS. If you like this demo in particular and my work in general and you want me to be able to continue putting stuff out, please consider one of the following:

* showing your appreciation with a donation:

* getting me something from [my Amazon WishList](https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2Y3C4722GXH0I/)

* or at least sharing this to show the rest of the world what can be done on the web these days with very little code and without any libraries

Thank you!
