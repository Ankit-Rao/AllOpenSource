# Pure CSS loader #10/ 2020 - NO SVG arcs (Chromium only, sorry!)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/povLmzO](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/povLmzO).

Needs [native `conic-gradient()` support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-conic-gradients) and Houdini support to work (Experimental Web Platform features flag enabled). So at this point (January 2020), it's Chromium only.

If the work I've been putting out since 2012 has helped you in any way or you just like it, you can support it with a gift to keep me afloat:
