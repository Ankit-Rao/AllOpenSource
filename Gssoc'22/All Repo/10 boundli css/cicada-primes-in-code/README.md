# Cicada: primes in code

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/rbYbQb](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/rbYbQb).

The numbers in the code for this Pen are almost only prime ones (save for some 0s and 1s). The SVG cicada in the middle is hand-coded, took me half a day to get something decent. The animation of its wings uses JS because I didn't have it in me to deal with the inconsistent mess that SVG + CSS can be. All other animations are CSS keyframe animations.

Oh, you should probably know my caring for cross-browser consistency stopped extending to Edge the moment the switch to Chromium was announced.
