# Pure CSS loader #17 - set of 1 element loaders (uses Houdini, Chromium only)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/MWYqMxd](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/MWYqMxd).

Needs [native `conic-gradient()` support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-conic-gradients) and Houdini support to work (Experimental Web Platform features flag enabled). So at this point (January 2020), it's Chromium only.

[Here's how it should look](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EOd8KkyWsAAUrL0.jpg).

If the work I've been putting out since 2012 has helped you in any way or you just like it, you can support it with a gift to keep me afloat:
