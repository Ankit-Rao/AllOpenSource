# threesome - no longer lonely checkboxes

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/LBxZOa](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/LBxZOa).

Fully functional only in Blink browsers with the Experimental Web Platform features flag enabled. Background transition doesn't work otherwise. No transitions at all in Firefox. Edge is completely broken, whatever.

I **DID NOT** design these checkboxes. [Original design](http://www.freebiesgallery.com/toggle-buttons/).
