# Toggle with Houdini magic ✨🎩🐇 (Chromium only transition)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/zZQQzV](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/zZQQzV).

[See me code this](https://youtu.be/svsYYb7senA). It's a clean markup, Houdini-animated version of this [Pen](https://codepen.io/kkanyingi/pen/mWYMzV) based on this [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/2309834-Yet-another-toggle-animation) by Andrei Mironov.

The basic functionality of switching from one state to the other is cross-browser, but the smooth transition between states only works in browsers supporting Houdini, which is just Chromium browsers for now. See [what Houdini means for animating transforms](https://css-tricks.com/what-houdini-means-for-animating-transforms/).
