# Thermostat with form elements & CSS variables

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/eGvNjr](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/eGvNjr).

[Watch me code this in ~50 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhwGL1I9LP0) (you can speed it up if you feel I'm typing/ speaking too slow).  Tested and looks as intended in Chrome/ Opera with Experimental Web Platform Features flag enabled in `chrome://flags/` (or `opera://flags` if you're using Opera) - this gives us support for native conic gradients so we can use CSS variables as stops.

For WebKit browsers not supporting native `conic-gradient()`, the demo is functional, it's just that the `track` is all a dim grey, as it can be seen below:

For Firefox, the `conic-gradient()` polyfill kicks in and, while we don't have support for CSS variables this way, the track is an orange to red gradient from start to end.

For Edge... sorry, but I'll try when it supports using `calc()` for angle values.

* or at least sharing this to show the rest of the world what can be done  on the web these days, using only HTML form elements, CSS and vanilla JavaScript


Thank you!

[The original](https://codepen.io/simoberny/pres/wrGoZZ) was made with `div` elements, so my version tried to recreate the visual result with form elements and CSS variables.
