# slider with chart output + fallback #12

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/opaEJL](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/opaEJL).

Adding a transition between normal styles and focus styles. We only see the chart if we have native `conic-gradient()` support, otherwise we see the fallback.
