# Pure CSS loader #18 - sliced cube (uses Houdini, Chromium only)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/GRgYQge](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/GRgYQge).

Needs Houdini support to work (Experimental Web Platform features flag enabled). So at this point (January 2020), it's Chromium only.

In the future it, we should be able to register the CSS variables from the CSS, which will make the JS unnecessary and the demo truly CSS-only.

Should work like in [this video](https://twitter.com/anatudor/status/1219137106548875264).
