# #codeVember #3/2021: SVG icon glassmorphism (no JS, hover icons to see effect)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/XWaVYZy](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/XWaVYZy).

SVG version of [this pure CSS emoji glassmorphism effect demo](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/mdwYmWW). You can also see a [video of me coding it from scratch](https://youtu.be/nL2GHIY_JKc) in ~20min or a [detailed article I wrote for CSS-Tricks on this topic](https://css-tricks.com/icon-glassmorphism-effect-in-css/) exploring the how behind it.
