# follow one #2 - CSS variables version

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/eymjmR](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/eymjmR).

[Watch me code this in ~13 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNOaIlqjfqI) .  Tested and fully works in Chrome/ Opera and Firefox 57+. Edge doesn't support `calc()` as a value for `animation-delay` or inside `rotate()`.

If you like this demo in particular and my work in general and you want me to be able to continue putting stuff out, please consider one of the following:

* showing your appreciation with a donation:

* or at least sharing this to show the rest of the world what can be done with CSS on the web these days

Thank you!
