# Pure CSS loader  #13/ 2020 - little drops of heaven

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/QWwxVWw](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/QWwxVWw).

Uses [the shape blobbing technique](https://css-tricks.com/shape-blobbing-css/) plus transforms on both the container and its children. Not the most clever way to do this, but it's pretty much cross-browser.
