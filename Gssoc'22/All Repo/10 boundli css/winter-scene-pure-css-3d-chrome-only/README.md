# Winter scene (pure CSS 3D, Chrome only)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/vpyPmN](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/vpyPmN).

Watch me code this in 2 parts: [part 1 (~35minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeQvfZE33Fw)  and [part 2 (~40 minutes)](https://youtu.be/FHcZAAwZ91s).  Tested and fully works in Chrome/ Opera with Experimental Web Platform Features flag enabled. Firefox doesn't support conic-gradient & all else is super laggy. Doesn't work in Edge due to the lack of support for `calc()` in `rotate()`.

If you like this demo in particular and my work in general and you want me to be able to continue putting stuff out, please consider one of the following:

Thank you!
