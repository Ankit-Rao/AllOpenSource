# Back to blue SVG loader (no Firefox)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/qYXVxY](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/qYXVxY).

[Watch me code this](https://youtu.be/f-XjhS7S5QQ) in 8 minutes, under 30 lines of CSS and under 15 lines of SVG. Doesn't work in Firefox. Might work in latest Edge (17, but haven't been able to test) If you like this demo in particular and my work in general and you want me to be able to continue putting stuff out, please consider one of the following:

Thank you!
