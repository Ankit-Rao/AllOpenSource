A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/GNYvbZ](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/GNYvbZ).

Live coded in 30 min on the 13th of December 2016. Tested & works in Chrome. Firefox has 3D order issues. Edge has problems when using both 3D transforms & filters + 3D transform animation issues. Inspired by [this Shutterstock video](http://ak6.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/14118056/preview/stock-footage--d-cube-vector-illustration-for-your-design-simple-geometric-cube-icon.mp4).
