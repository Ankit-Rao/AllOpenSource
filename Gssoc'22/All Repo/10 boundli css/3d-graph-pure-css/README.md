# 3D graph (pure CSS)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/dMEKYO](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/dMEKYO).

Live coded in ~30min on the 17th of May 2016. See also my [2nd pure CSS animated 3D graph](http://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/jqoQOO). Tested & works in current Chrome and Firefox on Windows 7. Won't work in IE because it uses `transform-style: preserve-3d`. Won't work in Edge either because it uses both filters and 3D transforms.
