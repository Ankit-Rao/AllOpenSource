# Pure CSS loader #24 - liquid drop (Houdini, so Chromium only)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/yLywVzd](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/yLywVzd).

Animates custom properties via Houdini and uses custom properties inside a `conic-gradient()`, so it can only work in browsers that support this stuff. Which, at the moment (January 2020), means only Chromium browsers, sorry.

Registering custom properties in order to animate them should be possible from the CSS in the future, which is why I chose to still include this among my pure CSS demos.

Here's [a video](https://twitter.com/anatudor/status/1221016633352904705) of what it should look like.
