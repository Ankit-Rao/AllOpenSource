# Bars with CSS vars and Houdini magic (Blink only with flag)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/MQOQmM](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/MQOQmM).

I only coded this in a modern and efficient fashion. I did NOT design it. Here is the [original design](https://dribbble.com/shots/2074084-Menu-Button-Bars). I haven't been able to reproduce the feel of the animation, so if you can do that, please fork it and work your magic.

Works only in Blink browsers with the Experimental Web Platform features flag enabled. See screenshot below for how to enable in Chrome: go to `chrome://flags`, search for this flag and enable.
