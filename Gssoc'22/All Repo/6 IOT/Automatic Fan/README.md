# Automatic Fan
## AIM:
To Start the Fan as the Temperature Increaes.

## Purpose:
Temperature Controlled Fan

## Short Description:
**Requirements:**
- Arduino UNO
- LCD 16X2
- Temperature Sensor (TMP36)
- Potentiometer (50 Kohm)
- Fan
- Push Button
(Tinkercad can also be used)

## Workflow:
- First we initialise TMP36 PIN, Fan Pin.
- We initiate a Conditional statement For the Fan to Start as temperature increases.
- A Resistor (1 Kohm) is added For the LCD and Resistor (10 Kohm) to the push button.

## Setup instructions:
- Assemble the circuit as shown below.
- Upload the code provided [here]()
- Run to see the project in action!
