# Interactive SVG Info Graph

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/pyrografix/pen/LZPMBg](https://codepen.io/pyrografix/pen/LZPMBg).

I've been working on a similar mechanism for a client recently and this was an initial test. I thought it had some promise so I spent a bit longer on it getting it working a bit better.

It's not perfect but it did the job which was to demonstrate what SVG is capable of.
